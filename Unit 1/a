A:
On mondays at school a group of us always talk about whatever movies we saw at the weekend
On saturdays i often get together with my classmates and we see all the latest releases together
I can't remember the last time i saw a film with my parents, we just don't have much in common anymore.

B:
My parents are both teachers, so you'd imagine I'd have no trouble at all academically.
When I was little it was great because we had a great relationship
but nowadays all we seem to do is argue and that causes a lot of conflict between us,
so i don't really feel i can go to them for help.
my friends aren't much help either, as they all got the same problem.
Thank goodness I get on really well with my tutor at university,
she is very approachable and if I'm struggling with an assignment I find her advice really helps me.

C:
My parents are quite old,
so I feel as though they are out of touch with the modern world,
they don't seem to have any idea of what things cost.
I'm hoping to get a car in the next few months but i'll be taking my older brother along to help.
We used to fight a lot when we were growing up, but there's a really close bond between us now.
He's already had a few cars so I'm sure he'll be a great help.

D:
I play the violin and the piano,
and my granddad is a great cello player.
A lot of my friends at school listen to all the popular bands and singers but my taste is totally different.
I prefer classical music and they just don't understand it at all.
Luckily granddad shares my taste. So we often buy cds and talk about them together.
